                            A board game made in NetLogo that heavily utilizes turtles-own and patches-own properties to create an interactive game between 2 players. Has a historical side to it with certain colored patches being markets for the turtles (traders) to stop by at. You can see the prices of goods at certain markets (^price-check) or what you have in your bag during your turn (^bag-check). This game has a lot of complex components, but it will be easy for you to get a hang of it once you read THE INSTRUCTIONS at the INFO tab near the top.<br><br> I mainly coded this game because it dealt with several topics like history, strategy, and trade.
